<h1>The Beatles - "All You Need Is Love"</h1>

<p> This simple chart shows all the words and how many times they are repeated throughout the lyrics. I made this for a Data Structures 
  class at Brooklyn College</p>
<p> This chart was produced in the following manner:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The code for finding the frequency of each word is a simple implementation of a HashMap in Java</li>
  <li>The HashMap is then output to a .csv file</li>
  <li>The .csv file is processed by another Java class which utilizes <a href="https://github.com/jtablesaw/tablesaw">Tablesaw</a> dataframe and vizualization library, which in turn uses <a href="https://github.com/plotly">Plot.ly</a> to produce graphs like this one. </li>
</ul>
